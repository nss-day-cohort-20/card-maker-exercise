>Linking objects together to share properties and delegate behavior

# Greeting Card Maker
The existing `cardMaker` object below contains a single method that returns a greeting. Your job is to 
add one or more methods to it, then use it as a prototype for at least three other objects using `Object.create()`

## Minimum requirement
Each new object should represent a different type of greeting card, such as birthday or Valentine's Day, with its own unique properties. Output two messages, one from the front and one from the inside of the card, to the console. 

## Challenges 
+ Make additional objects that allow more specific card types, such as children's birthday and adult's birthday,
that inherit from a `Birthday` object.
+ Output the HTML strings with classes to the DOM that you can style with CSS. 
+ Refactor "makeFrontMessage" to return something more elaborate. 

```
const CardMaker = {
  makeFrontMessage: function(string) {
    return `<h2>${string}</h2>`
  }
}

//Refactor this to link this object to cardMaker
const BirthdayCard = Object.create();
```
